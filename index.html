<p>Intro</p>
<p> This is my teams website. We code video games for the public to enjoy. So far we have not created any video games, but we will have lots of varitie. We will have games and fangames alike and we will produce 2d and 3d games as well. As our first game we will make will be making a Sonic The Hedgehog fangame titled Sonic Clash. To learn more about our 2d platformer Sonic Clash, read the next paragraph.</p>
<p> SONIC CLASH</p>
<p> Sonic Clash is a 2d sidescroller about Sonic The Hedgehog that is a mixture between speed and platforming. The story is that Dr. Robotnik tricks sonic into falling through a tube which leads him to a christmas green hill zone. There are over 10 playable characters in game, including Mario! </p>
